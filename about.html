            <p>Hello! I am Matt Munson, a college student at Michigan State University, Majoring in Information Science and Minoring in Information Technology.
            I'm a senior here at MSU about to graduate in the Fall of 2024. Throughout my time at Michigan State I have learned a lot about myself and where my
            future is taking me.
            </p>
            <p>I have always wanted to work at a high tech company such as Microsoft, Google, or Meta to expand my horizons in software development. This has been
            a dream of mine ever since I was a freshman in Highschool and hope to one day make it a reality. I have had some experience within this field at an
            internship I had last summer with United Wholesale Mortgage (UWM) they have taught me the ins and outs that come with this job and that everything is
            made in-house.
            </p>

        <div class="about-me">
            <h2>My Skills and Interests</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Soccer - 13+ years</li>
                <li>Videogames</li>
                <li>MSU Varsity Rocket League Player</li>

        <div class="about-me">
            <p>In addition to my interests I also enjoy spending time outside with friends and taking long hikes. Some of my favorite places I have Traveled to include
            Hawaii, Rome, and the Bahamas. This seems like the exact opposite of what someone who enjoys being in the confides of their own home, but getting outdoors
            clears my head and can make life so much more enjoyable.
